abstract: "Ontario is relaxing its COVID-19 measures even though health care experts are predicting an incoming sixth wave of COVID-19. It is crucial for us to continue taking measures to protect ourselves and the people around us and to seek insights to keep ourselves inform. In this paper, we provide an up-to-date analysis of the various aspects of COVID-19 with an emphasis of the past six months. We found that seniors are still the most susceptible population group after two years into the COVID-19 pandemic."
